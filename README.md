# True Test
This is an example project designed to show the power of combining different automated testing techniques to create the most stable possible projects.  The idea behind this project was to give a basic framework for using all of the following techniques:

* Test Driven Development
* Acceptance Criteria/Behavior Drive Development
* Properties Based Testing
* Mutation Testing

The Application is written in Java and utilizes the [Spock Framework](http://spockframework.org), with [Spock Genesis](https://github.com/Bijnagte/spock-genesis) for properties based testing and [Pitest](http://pitest.org) for Mutation Testing.
